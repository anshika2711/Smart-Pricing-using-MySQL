# 🧠 Smart Pricing Optimization Tool (SQL + Streamlit)

This project is a data-driven pricing optimization engine designed for quick commerce platforms (like Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart). It helps optimize discounting by analyzing user behavior, product margins, and conversion patterns — all built using MySQL (or PlanetScale), SQL views, and Streamlit for interactive visualization.

---

## 🚀 Business Context

Quick commerce operates on thin margins and fast delivery. Random discounting can burn contribution margins. This tool helps:

- 🎯 Offer the right discount to the right user cohort (price-sensitive vs loyal)
- 📉 Avoid over-discounting where users would've purchased anyway
- 🧾 Identify loss leaders (popular but low-margin SKUs)
- 📈 Simulate discount changes on conversion and margins

## 📷 Sample Dashboard Preview

1. Select City Tier and Loyalty Segment from dropdowns  
2. Choose a product  
3. View charts:
   - 📈 Conversion Rate vs Discount %
   - 💰 Average Margin % vs Discount %
4. See optimal discount recommendation based on SQL logic

## 💡 Example Insight

> For Tier-1 Mid-Loyalty users buying “Amul Butter”, conversion jumps to 75% at 10% discount — with 20% margin. Thus, 10% is the optimal discount.
